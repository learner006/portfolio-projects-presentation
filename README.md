ABOUT
=====
This repository contains the projects' description I would like to share to get the job.


DESIGN
======

I developed design for all the four projects. I used Inkscape to draw a logo, pictures and decoration elements. I picked the (free) pictures I like on stocks' sites and 
did use them. I have also used the Adobe Photoshop to retouch the picture of a yoga man and the picture of Taj Mahal as well. (I do not rely on Photoshopo heavily when creating websites just to brush an idea. It saves a lot of time.) 

TECH STACK
==========
It is all about the frontend mostly: HTML, CSS, SVG (with animations), JavaScript + some browser API (requestAnimationFrame).

All the sites have a responsive design (through the CSS' media queries).

VIDEOS
======
The [__video__](https://github.com/learner006/portfolio-projects-presentation/tree/main/video) directory is a place for stunning videos! :-)

002 Random post (Yoga theme frontend)
